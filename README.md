# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
module 7, analyzing potential employee retirements

## Overview of Pewlett-Hackard employee retirement analysis
This analysis aims to:
* Determine the number of retiring employees per title
* Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Results
* 90,398 employees were born between 1952 and 1955.
* The Senior Engineers have the largest number of employees born between 1952 and 1955 (29,414), followed by Senior Staff (28,254). 
* The Managers have the smallest number of employees born between 1952 and 1955 (2).
* There are 1,549 employess who were born in 1965 and are eligable for the mentorship program. 


## Summary
There will be 90,398 roles that need to be filled as current employees reach retirement age. There are 1,549 employees who fit the criteria for the mentorship program, or 1.7% of employees who are reaching retirement age. I would recommend future analysis focus on the number of employees who were born in 1955 instead of 1965 as this population is more representative of the younger age of current employees who are reaching retirement age.
